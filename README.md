# 🎧 Real-Time Analytics Dashboard – Music Player Edition (WebSocket + Kafka)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a two-pane web application that simulates a lightweight real-time analytics system. It is meant to feel similar in concept to tools like PostHog or Amplitude — but intentionally scaled down, built from scratch using Kafka and WebSockets.

The application has two panes:

- **Right Pane**: A mock **music player UI** (similar to Spotify), used to generate frontend events.
- **Left Pane**: An **analytics dashboard** that receives and visualizes those events in real-time.

---

## 🧱 Stack Overview

### 🔹 Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons + custom components
- **Data Transport**: `socket.io-client` for real-time log streaming
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, time series)

### 🔹 Backend (Node.js + Kafka + WebSocket)
- **Kafka Client**: `kafkajs` — receives frontend log events into topic `frontend-events`
- **WebSocket Server**: `socket.io` — reads from Kafka topic and pushes to dashboards in real-time
- **Express**: REST API endpoints for health checks and event logging
- **Security**: Helmet.js for security headers, CORS configuration

  D --> E[Dashboard UI (React)]
````

* **Kafka** gives durability and decoupling — frontend events don’t go straight to the dashboard
* **WebSockets** provide low-latency event delivery for a smooth, real-time feel
* **Dashboard UI** is fully reactive and updates immediately with streamed logs

---

## 🖥 UI Design: Two-Pane Layout

* 🟪 **Right Pane** = `MusicPlayer.tsx`
  A beautiful Spotify-like interface with:
  * Album art with animated play indicator
  * Track info (title, artist, album)
  * Progress bar with seek functionality
  * Play/pause, skip controls
  * Like and add to playlist buttons
  * Volume control with mute toggle
  * Gradient background with modern styling

* 🟨 **Left Pane** = `Dashboard.tsx`
  A comprehensive analytics dashboard with:
  * Real-time event feed with detailed information
  * Interactive charts (pie, bar, timeline)
  * Filtering controls for events, tracks, and users
  * Live statistics counters
  * Responsive grid layout

---

## 🔁 Event Flow

1. A user interacts with the Music Player (e.g. presses play, scrubs a track).
2. The frontend logs the event and sends it:

   * **Via WebSocket** → Backend server → Kafka (`frontend-events`)
3. Backend consumes logs from Kafka and emits them:

   * **Via WebSocket** → Dashboard UI

---

## 🔧 Kafka Details

* **Kafka Topic**: `frontend-events`
* Used to **decouple producer (music player)** from **consumer (dashboard)**
* Log events are sent to Kafka and streamed to dashboard via socket
* **No DB persistence** for now — logs are ephemeral, in-memory, or Kafka-durable only

---

## 🧾 Example Log Event (Scrub Action)

This event is triggered when a user scrubs (seeks) to a new timestamp in the track.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-28T18:42:01Z",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "user-007",
  "event_type": "scrub",
  "track_id": "track-007",
  "from_timestamp": 25,
  "to_timestamp": 74
}
```

All logs follow this JSON schema and are enriched with:

* `timestamp`
* `session_id`, `user_id`
* `event_type` (`play`, `pause`, `scrub`, etc.)
* `track_id` (for grouping/funnel analytics)
* Optional: browser, device, viewport metadata

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the setup script (requires Docker)
./setup.sh

# Start both server and client
npm run dev
```

### Test Mode (No Docker Required)

```bash
# Start test server (in-memory, no Kafka)
npm run test:server

# In another terminal, start the client
npm run dev:client
```

### Manual Setup

#### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

#### 2. Start Kafka (via Docker)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### 3. Start the WebSocket + Kafka Server

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

#### 4. Start the React Client

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

### Access Points

- **Client**: http://localhost:5173
- **Server Health**: http://localhost:3001/health
- **Kafka UI**: http://localhost:8080

The application will automatically create the `frontend-events` Kafka topic on first run.

## 📡 WebSocket Server Code Sample

```js
// socketServer.js
const { Kafka } = require("kafkajs");
const io = require("socket.io")(3001, {
  cors: { origin: "*" }
});

const kafka = new Kafka({ brokers: ["localhost:9092"] });
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: "dashboard-consumer" });
const producer = kafka.producer();

(async () => {
  await producer.connect();
  await consumer.connect();
  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: "frontend-events", fromBeginning: false });

  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log("New client connected");

    socket.on("log_event", async (event) => {
      await producer.send({
        topic: "frontend-events",
        messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify(event) }],
      });
    });
  });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());
      io.emit("new_event", data); // send to all dashboard clients
    }
  });
})();
```

---

## 🌐 Frontend Socket Helper

```ts
// utils/socket.ts
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

export const socket = io("http://localhost:3001");

export const logEvent = (eventData: any) => {
  socket.emit("log_event", eventData);
};

export const onNewEvent = (callback: (data: any) => void) => {
  socket.on("new_event", callback);
};
```

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* 🗂 Add persistent DB (PostgreSQL or SQLite) for replay/history
* 🔁 Add session playback ("replay" past sessions step-by-step)
* 📈 Track engagement metrics per track
* 🔐 Add user login / auth to track across sessions
* 🔄 Switch to Kafka Streams or Apache Flink for real-time enrichment

---

## ✅ Summary

This project is a fully working MVP of a real-time client-side analytics system, featuring:

* **React 18 + TypeScript** for the frontend with Vite build tool
* **Kafka** as the event bus (single topic: `frontend-events`) with fallback to in-memory storage
* **WebSockets** for real-time communication
* **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS and modern design patterns
* **Real-time analytics** with interactive charts and live event feed
* **No persistent DB** — everything is self-built and simple to extend

The dashboard provides actionable, developer-facing metrics and gives a great foundation for analytics systems or real-time streaming UI. The application works both with Kafka (production mode) and without (test mode) for easy development and testing.
